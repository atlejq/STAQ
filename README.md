Based on:

"FOCAS Automatic Catalog Matching Algorithms", https://doi.org/10.1086/133667

"Pattern Matching with Differential Voting and Median Transformation Derivation", https://doi.org/10.1007/1-4020-4179-9_146

This repo is not being maintained as the software has been migrated to Python (see the HydraSTAQ repo).
